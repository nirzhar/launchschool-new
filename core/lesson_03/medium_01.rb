# Question 01
# Let's do some "ASCII Art" (a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the
# days before computers had video screens).

# For this practice problem, write a one-line program that creates the following
# output 10 times, with the subsequent line indented 1 space to the right:
# The Flintstones Rock!
#  The Flintstones Rock!
#   The Flintstones Rock!

10.times { | x | puts (" " * x) + "The Flintstones Rock!"}

# Question 9

# Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a function
# called rps as follows, which follows the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors
# game, but with a slight twist that it declares whatever hand was used in
# the tie as the result of that tie.

def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
