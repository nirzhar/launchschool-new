# Methods Problems 01

# 1: What is the return value of the select method below? Why?
[1, 2, 3].select do |num|
  num > 5
  'hi'
end

puts puts
# select performs selection based onthe truthiness of the block's return value.
# in this case the return value will always be 'hi' which is a "truthy" value.
# SO, select will return a new array containing all
# of the elementsns in the originla array.

# 2: How does count treat the block's return value? How can we find out?
['ant', 'bat', 'caterpillar'].count do |str|
  str.length < 4
end

puts puts
# If a block is given, counts the number of elements for which the block returns a true value.
# Based on this information, we can conclude that count only counts an element
# if the block's return value evaluates to true. This means that count considers
# the truthiness of the block's return value.

# 3: What is the return value of reject in the following code? Why?
[1, 2, 3].reject do |num|
  puts num
end

# => [1, 2, 3]
# reject returns a new array containing items where the block's return value
# is "falsey". In other words, if the return value was false or nil the element
# would be selected.
puts puts

# 4: What is the return value of each_with_object in the following code? Why?
['ant', 'bear', 'cat'].each_with_object({}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value[0]] = value
end

# => {"a" => "ant", "b" => "bear", "c" => "cat"}
# When we invoke each_with_object, we pass in an object ({} here) as an argument.
# That object is then passed into the block and it's updated value is returned at
# the end of each iteration. Once each_with_object has iterated over the calling
# collection, it returns the initially given object, which now contains all of the
# updates.
# In this code, we start with the hash object, {}. On the first iteration, we add
# "a" => "ant" to the hash. On the second, we add "b" => "bear", and on the last
# iteration, we add "c" => "cat". Thus, #each_with_object in this example returns
# a hash with those 3 elements.


puts puts

# 5: What does shift do in the following code? How can we find out?
hash = { a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }
hash.shift

puts puts
# Removes a key-value pair from hsh and returns it as the two-item array
# [ *key, value* ], or the hashâ€™s default value if the hash is empty.


# 6: What is the return value of the following statement? Why?
['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

puts puts
# 11
# First, pop is being called on the array. pop destructively removes the last
# element from the calling array and returns it. Second, size is being called on
# the return value by pop. Once we realize that size is evaluating the
# return value of pop (which is "caterpillar") then the final return value of 11
# should make sense.

# 7: What is the block's return value in the following code? How is it determined?
# Also, what is the return value of any? in this code and what does it output?

[1, 2, 3].any? do |num|
  puts num
  num.odd?
end

# => 1
# The return value of the block is determined by the return value of the last
# expression within the block. In this case the last statement evaluated is num.odd?,
# which returns a boolean. Therefore the block's return value will be a boolean,
# since Fixnum#odd? can only return true or false.

# Since the Array#any? method returns true if the block ever returns a value other
# than false or nil, and the block returns true on the first iteration, we know that
# any? will return true. What is also interesting here is any? stops iterating after
# this point since there is no need to evaluate the remaining items in the array;
# therefore, puts num is only ever invoked for the first item in the array: 1.
puts puts

# 8: How does take work? Is it destructive? How can we find out?
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.take(2)

# =>  [1, 2]
# arr still is intact: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# we're able to determine that Array#take selects a specified number of elements
# from an array. We're also able to verify that it isn't a destructive method.
puts puts

# 9: What is the return value of map in the following code? Why?
{ a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }.map do |key, value|
  if value.size > 3
    value
  end
end

# [nil, 'bear']

# There are some interesting things to point out here. First, the return value
# of map is an array, which is the collection type that map always returns.
# Second, where did that nil come from? If we look at the if condition (value.size > 3),
# we'll notice that it evaluates to true when the length of value is greater than 3.
# In this case, the only value with a length greater than 3 is 'bear'.
# This means that for the first element, 'ant', the condition evaluates to false
# and value isn't returned.
puts puts

# When none of the conditions in an if statement evaluates as true, the if statement
# itself returns nil. That's why we see nil as the first element in the returned array.

# 10: What is the return value of the following code? Why?
[1, 2, 3].map do |num|
  if num > 1
    puts num
  else
    num
  end
end

# [1, nil, nil]
# => We can determine the block's return value by looking at the return value of
# the last statement evaluated within the block. In this case it's a bit tricky
# because of the if statement. For the first element, the if condition evaluates
# to false, which means num is the block's return value for that iteration.
# For the rest of the elements in the array, num > 1 evaluates to true, which
# means puts num is the last statement evaluated, which in turn, means that the
# block's return value is nil for those iterations.

# Therefore, the return value of map is:
# [1, nil, nil]
puts puts
